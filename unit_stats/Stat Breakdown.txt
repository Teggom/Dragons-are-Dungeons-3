Given a player with 30 strength, 21 luck, level 2 athletics, and gloves of strength, and a level 1 ring of athletics
Assume you wish to move a rock
    rock needs a roll of 20 to move
That rock has built in stats related to various checks
    Selecting the rock, and trying to use Athletics
        Athletics is 100% Strength
            Thus your premod stat is 30 (all strength) 
                30 will convert to about +6            
            Your gloves of strength increase your strength by 5
                this gives you a premod stat of 35
                    converts to +7
        Your level 2 in athletics gives you +5
            level 1 ring of athletics is calculated separately
                gives you +2 athletics
        Your 21 luck converts to +3 LUCK mod
        Thus, your roll against moving the rock is 
            1d20 <default>
            + 7 <stat mod>
            + 5 <skill level>
            + 2 <equipment>
            + 1d3 <LUCK mod>
        For a total of 
            1d20 + 1d3 + 14
                min of 16
                max of 37
the rock has moved
    The odds of the rock moving were 17/21
    Thus exp received is as follows
        1-17/21 = 4/21 ~= 0.19
        Rock had skill check of 20
            Assuming I keep an expo of 1.5
        floor(20 ^ 1.5) = 89
        thus there is 89 exp to be given
        Half of this exp goes to athletics
        Half of this exp goes to the stats that make up athletics
        Thus, strength gets ceiling(89/2) exp
            45 exp
        Thus, Athletics gets ceiling(89/2) exp
            45 exp
