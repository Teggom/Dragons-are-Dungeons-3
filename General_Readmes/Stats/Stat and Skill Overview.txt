        Max skill level is 100
            Skill cap unbounded
            101+ gives same bonus
    Secondary Stats
        Cannot level up
        Can be modified with traits/conditions/equipment
        Luck
            converts into a dice bonus the same way a regular stat does
            Bonus is not flat, bonus is a 1d<bonus>
        Memory 
            dungeon layout is forgotten at a rate of <since last seen> / (memory ^ 4)
            Calculation may change
        Sight   
            Affects how many tiles can be seen around the character
                Applies to enemies as well
        Perception
            Higher tiers of perception allow you to gleam more information when looking at an object
                a locked metal door might just be reported as a door with low perception
    Skills
        Skills are used to perform any action
        Successfully performing the action will grant you experience towards that skill and the stats that make up that skill
        Skill Dice Roll calculations are as follows
        1d20 + 1d<luck Mod> + <equipment Bonus> + <trait Bonus> + <condition bonus> + <skill Bonus> + <skill level bonus>
